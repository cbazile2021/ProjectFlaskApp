# üìö Voice-to-Book Q&A Web App ‚Äì by Charles Bazile

## üìå Description
This Flask-based web application enables users to:
- üìò **Upload a PDF book** for reference.
- üé§ **Record a question using their voice**, which is transcribed and answered **using only the content of the uploaded book**.
- ü§ñ Responses are generated using **Google Vertex AI's Gemini 2.5 multimodal model**.

üîÅ All interactions (audio, transcript, answer) are processed and saved for reference.

> ‚ú® Previous APIs (Speech-to-Text, Natural Language, Text-to-Speech) were **replaced** with a single multimodal LLM call for efficiency and better performance.
