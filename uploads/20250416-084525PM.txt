Answer from Book:
Based on the provided text:

The book is titled "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The narrator introduces Gatsby as "the man who gives his name to this book." He describes Gatsby as someone who represented everything the narrator scorns, yet also possessed something "gorgeous," a "heightened sensitivity to the promises of life," an "extraordinary gift for hope," and a "romantic readiness." The narrator clarifies that his disillusionment stemmed not from Gatsby himself, but from "what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams." The narrator also discusses his own background, his tendency to reserve judgments based on his father's advice, and his experiences returning from "the East."
